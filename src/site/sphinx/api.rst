API Description

Directory Data Structure
------------------------

The directory contains directory entries.
Each directory entry consists of a channel name, an arbitrary set of properties (name-value pairs), and an arbitrary set of tags (names).
Each of these elements has an owner group, which can be set by the user that created the element.
All names and values are strings.
Channel names, tags, property names, and owner (group) names are all case insensitive.


Service Type
------------

The ChannelFinder service is implemented as a REST style web service, which – in this context – means: 

| •  The URL specifies the data element that the operation works upon.
| •  The HTTP method specifies the type of operation.

| GET: retrieve or query, does not modify data
| PUT: create or update, replacing the addressed element
| POST: create or update subordinates of the addressed element
| DELETE: delete the addressed element

All operations are idempotent, i.e. when repeatedly applying the identical operation, only the first execution will change the database.

•  The payload (HTTP body) always contains a representation of data.
•  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer for a detailed discussion.

Directory data can be uploaded and retrieved in XML or JSON notation, the client specifies the type using standard HTTP headers (“Content-Type”, “Accepts”).

Ownership Restrictions
----------------------

All channels, properties, and tags have an owner. The owner is intended to be the name of a group, the service can find out membership through LDAP. Users can only set the ownership of entries to a group they belong to. (Unless they have Admin role.)
This allows for the binding of each property and tag to a certain user group, making sure that only users of that group can change property values, the ownership of existing properties and tags, or delete properties and tags.

Authorization, Authentication, and Encryption
---------------------------------------------

No authentication or encryption is required to query the service.
All operations that modify the directory require authentication and authorization to succeed. To avoid compromising authentication data, encrypted transport is available. Standard framework-supplied web server techniques are used.
For each authenticated user the user's group memberships are also received through LDAP.
The service's web descriptor defines four roles that are used in authorization, listed here ordered by decreasing rights. Each level includes all prior levels.

| •  Administrator: Overrides all ownership restrictions.
| •  ChannelMod: Needed for all operations that create, modify, or delete channels.
| •  PropertyMod: Needed for all operations that create, modify, or delete properties, or to modify property values.
| •  TagMod: Needed for all operations that create, modify, or delete tags.

The Roles are defined in the roles mapping section in the applications.properties.

XML and JSON Representation
------------------

Table 1 and Table 2 show the XML and JSON representations of directory entries, i.e. the payload format of the web service transactions.

 .. code-block::
 
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <root>
      <element>
        <name>ChannelName</name>
        <owner>cf-channels</owner>
        <properties>
          <element>
            <channels />
            <name>PropertyName</name>
            <value>PropertyValue</value>

                {
                    "name": "PropertyName",

                    "channels": []
                }
            ]
        }
    ]


Table 2: JSON Representation of Directory Data (Channels)

Payload data for properties and tags is the same as when part of a channel. Property and tag payloads may embed a <channels> list. This allows the operation that creates a tag to also attach the tag to a set of channels, and the operation that creates a property to set the property on the embedded list of channels. In the latter case the property's by-instance values are taken from the matching <property> item inside the property's channel list.

Web Service URLs and Operations
-------------------------------

The ChannelFinder service REST API is descriped below, each HTTP request URL has to be appended with the service URL

**http://<channelfinder_host>:<port>/ChannelFinder/resources**

e.g.

**http://<channelfinder_host>:<port>/ChannelFinder/resources/channels/my_test_channel**

Channel Resources
-----------------

**Retrieve a Channel** 

**.../channels/<name>**

Method: GET		Returns: Single Channel		Required Role: None

Return the full listing of a single channel with the given name.

**List Channels / Query by Pattern**

**.../channels?prop1=patt1&prop2=patt2&~tag=patt3&~name=patt4...**
 
Method: GET    Returns: List of Channels    Required Role: None

Return the list of channels which match all given expressions, i.e. the expressions are combined in a logical AND.
There are three types of expressions:

1. Value wildcards: <name>=<pattern>
True if a channel has a property with the given name, and its value matches the given pattern. Multiple expressions for the same property name are combined in a logical OR.

2. Tag name wildcards: ~tag=<pattern>
True if a channel has a tag or property whose name matches the given pattern.

3. Channel name wildcards: ~name=<pattern>
True if a channel name matches the given pattern.

Special keywords, e.g. “~tag” and “~name” for tag and channel name matches, have to start with the tilde character, else they are treated as property names in a value wildcard expression.
The patterns may contain file glob wildcard characters, i.e. “?” for a single character and “*” for any number of characters.

If called without URL parameters, the operation lists all channels in the directory.

-----------------
*Normal channel queries use pagination(with a 10,000 doc limit); use scroll for queries with long results(10,000+ docs).*
*Note that scroll size may be increased, but if increased above certain limits will likely require increasing the heap size(which can be set as a VM or command-line argument).
